        <h2>High School</h2>
        <p id="the-family">t="_blank"
            <br>The high school that I want to attend to is Millikan High School. I want to be a part of their <a href="https://lbmillikan.schoolloop.com/QWelcome" target="_blank">QUEST</a> program so that I get ahead in my high school career and get into a great college. This program is geared towards students who want to be in accelerated classes but don’t quite know what they want to do for a living.

        <h2>College</h2>
        <p>
         <br>I’m not sure what college I want to go to but I would like to apply to an Ivy League, Stanford, or a UC school. I will put my best effort into all of my work in high school for all four years in order to achieve this.

            <h2>Career Interests</h2>
        <p>
        <br>My interests for my career later in life is to be a lawyer or do some type of job with debating. Proving my point is very fun for me and observing other people’s point of view also sparks my interest. 
        </br>
        
        <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>
             In the future, I would like to get through college with a great GPA. I have had all accelerated classes with a 4.0 all through middle school and I want to keep at least a 3.6 in high school. Although keeping a 4.0 through all of high school would be nice, it’s not realistic, but I will try my best on all of my work.
