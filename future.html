        <h2>High School</h2>
        <p id="the-family">
            <br>The high school that I want to attend to is Millikan High School. I want to be a part of their QUEST program so that I get ahead in my high school career and get into a great college. This program is geared towards students who want to be in accelerated classes but don’t quite know what they want to do for a living.

        <h2>College</h2>
        <p>
         <br>I’m not sure what college I want to go to but I would like to apply to an Ivy League, Stanford, or a UC school. I will put my best effort into all of my work in high school for all four years in order to achieve this.

            <h2>Career Interests</h2>
        <p>
        <br>My interests for my career later in life is to be a lawyer or do some type of job with debating. Proving my point is very fun for me and observing other people’s point of view also sparks my interest. 
        </br>

        <h3>Interests</h3>
        <p>
        <br>An interest I have is traveling. I find it very fascinating to see different cultures in different countries. I have been to 4 countries other than the U.S. and this summer I will be touching upon eight more and I am so excited. I can’t wait to travel to more countries around the world.</br>
